# Demo
I'll be giving my demo during my Wednesday section with Katherine. 

# Details for Teaching Team
I'm having some issues with my Digital Ocean droplet, so the live URL actually isn't up yet. I've talked with Katherine about it, posted a question on piazza, and filed a help ticket with Digital Ocean, so hopefully it will be resolved soon, but at the moment it isn't working. Sorry for the trouble.
